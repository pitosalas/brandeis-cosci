REVIEW

* html and http are the core formats/protocols for the web
* remember the http 'methods'. Most common and important: GET and HEAD
* next: POST, PUT, DELETE, but they are rarely used

URLS

* the third core format of the web
* (what are the other two)
* a standard syntax to refer to any resource on the web
* what's a resource? 
* http://www.brandeis.edu. Tease apart the parts
* but what about this one, what's going on here?:     http://www.google.com/search?q=http+verbs&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
http://www.google.com/ig/api?weather=Arlington+MA (seehttp://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/02/08/googles-secret-weather-api/)

RPC - Remote Procedure Calls

* What's the connection with DNS?
* Imagine a procedure (method) : return_fortune_cookie.
* What would it mean to call it between two computers?
* What would it mean to call it between two computers over the internet?
* How would you approach it?

REST - A different way to think about RPC

 * HTTP Verbs: GET (HEAD), PUT, POST, DELETE.
 * Think of everything in terms of a 'resource' that is being manipulated
 * For example, GET means get a representation of the resource marked, e.g.
   GET http://www.facebook.com/user/pitosalas 
   GET http://www.facebok.com/users
 * Some things are harder to fit with the model
 * What does the fortune cookie request look like as REST?
 * http://brandes.edu/fortunes/1
 * http://brandeis.edu/fortunes
 * http://brandeis.edu/fortunes/random
 * Two advantages: 
  * some rhyme or reason on how to build urls and
  * make logical use of url space
  * Different 'representations' possible: html and xml, but others too, say csv or video
  * Big one: Standards allow caching in the cloud
  
* Is http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/02/08/googles-secret-weather-api/ a REST call?
* Now if we want to submit a new fortune to the fortune cookie server:
* POST http://brandeis.edu/fortune/create; the message would follow a particular format for a new fortune cookie; the result would be the fortune cookie number, ready for a http


* Try some more examples

CLOUD

* So what is really meant by 'cloud computing' ?
* What does it mean when a 'service' is 'in the cloud'?
* "Cloud computing is just a data center with an API"
* What's a data center? What does one look like
* How big is the Google data center do you think?

WEB BASED APIs

* lets look at some specifics
* Amazon S3. What is it.
* What does it cost? How can Amazon actually make it so cheap?
* Let's try to imagine with it looks like behind the scenes. What might it's architecture be?

DEMO: Lets do a quick ruby example with S3

* So there are numerous, numerous APIs
* Take a look at www.programmableweb.com

WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING

* 'Utility' computing
* 'Metered' computing
* What's being metered?
   - computes
   - storage
   - network connectivity
* What is the level?
   - a code snippet?
   - a virtual disk?
   - a service?

COMPARING MODELS

* Amazon Web Services
* Google App Service
* Others?

BROADENING DEFINITION

* PayPal payment service?
* Rack space
* Any web service?

ARCHITECTURAL TRADE-OFFS

* Buying disks and running them in a data center
* Buying computers
* How do you decide how many computers you need?
* How long does it take to add computers?
