BASIC APPS

* Far more limited hardware 
* Far more constraint and less freedom
* Divergence of platforms and programming models

PRESENTATION

* How does location awareness work?

CONTEXTUAL DIFFERENCES

* Will the app work when not connected to the net
* Connection speeds can vary wildly
* User expectation of responsiveness
* Device cannot crash or hang up

WHATS A PROGRAMMING MODEL

* How does the app get launched?
* How does the app find out when the user does something
* What happens to the app when it loses focus
* On Mac/Windows there are windows, tasks, dialog boxes, files, folders, etc
* Android totally different: Processes, Applications, Activities, Intents, etc.

MAJOR STRATEGY DIFFERENCES

* You need to pick device. Relatively little interop
* Device have wildly different penetration

TYPES OF MOBILE APP

* Web based pros and cons
  - UI somewhat less rich
  - will not work while disconnected
  - far easier to write
  - really easy to deploy
  - a 'chance' at interop
*  Client App
   - Richest UI
   - Will work while disconnected
   - Very tied to platform
   - Need to figure out a way to deploy
   - Can be harder to write
* Can / Should you do both?
