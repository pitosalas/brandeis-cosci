10-12 Basic Concepts of the Mobile World - Pito
12-1 Lunch
1-3 Hello word Android, setup/install simulator, using phones 
-----------

* student led presentation: How does location awareness work?

* How to think about the users. Who are they, what kinds of people?
* When are they using your app? Where are they at the time?
* How much are they able to focus on the app? 
* Are they being entertained or trying to solve a problem?
* What else?

* Broad types of mobile apps:
* Web based pros and cons
	- UI somewhat less rich
	- will not work while disconnected
	- far easier to write
	- really easy to deploy
	- a 'chance' at interop
	- No need to deal with 'app store'
*  Client App
	- Richest UI
	- Will work while disconnected
	- Very tied to platform
	- Need to figure out a way to deploy
	- Can be harder to write
	- Some hardware capabilities (camera, gps) may only be accessible
	- easy to charge money for it
	
* Can / Should you do both?

* information architecture usually means the navigation structure of an app
* principles are analogous as for web apps, but limitations come into play
* on mobile there is less space, less time, so info arch is simpler
* KISS principle again. Stay close to your goals
* "There should be only one way to do any particular thing": TRUE OR FALSE?
* Discoverability of features: how important? Does everything need to be discoverable?
* Teasing content: show a little preview of what lies behind the click
* Instrumentation in general: let the app measure user behavior
* Security and privacy paranoia / considerations
* Clickstream: collect info about what the user clicks on to find their way
* Wireframes: Very simplistic sketch of UI. Focus client/user on what it does not what it looks like
* Paper Prototypes: Paper wireframes. Good for usability testing and design
* HTML/Visio/OmniGraffle prototypes - also see http://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/

* Designing a mobile app
* Restate the context -- who are the users, what's going on when they are using the app, do they need to interact, or be entertained, or do they have a specific task, where are they physically, in a car, at a desk, at the office, on a plane, at a club?
* What 'impression' should your app give on first blush? Look and feel? What message should it convey?
* Get in the head of the user. Right now. What does he want to do? Can you tell by looking at the app right now how to do that?
* It's a subtle mind game

* Labels in info architecture must the core vocabulary of the user
* Labels also teach user about what the app does
* Keep them very simple one or at most two words

* What does typography, color and graphics convey
* Purpose of an icon: decorative and memory
* Does it matter if your app looks like another (or many other apps)
* Especially on mobile devices, the basic building blocks of the look are determined by the platform

* Screen sizes can vary from model to model
* Landscape vs. Portrait also
* You can simply re-scale the UI
* Or you can offer specific fetures in specific positions
* Which brings up the question of discoverability of features
