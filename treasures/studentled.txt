=== Student Led Discussions ===

Every Wednesday one student will be required to lead a 15-30 minute, informal discussion on one of these topics. 
You should each select a topic you would like to present and on which Wednesday you prefer to do it. 

Basically what you will have to do is to research on the web or anywhere else information about the topic and plan to have an interactive presentation/discussion about the topic so that we can all learn from your work. We will ask questions but don't expect that you need to be an instant expert on the topic.

You show us web sites, applications, code samples, or even slides. 

We're available to give you more details or tips if you ask

Here are the topics to pick from:

=== TOPICS === 

  * Python and Django compared to Ruby and Rails
  * Dynamic Languages: Ruby, Python, Groovy and Java
  * DNS. Demo of the protocol, explanation of how the system works
  * Non-SQL Databases. What are they, when are they interesting. How to use them
  * Chrome vs. Firefox vs. Safari vs. Internet Explorer
  * Google Android OS vs. Apple OS X vs. MS Windows 7
