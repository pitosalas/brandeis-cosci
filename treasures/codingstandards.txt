All code handed in should follow these basic professional standard. Note that you will get three attempts to hand something in (before it gets graded)

All source files start with a comment block header explaining:
* the name of the program
* briefly its purpose
* your name
* specific preconditions to running it (e.g. install this gem)
* command line(s) to run it and demonstrate that it works
* All classes and methods are preceded by something explaining it (can be as little as one sentence.)
* Variable and other names should be well chosen. (Hint: if it's one letter, it may not be so well chosen.)
