=== JBS INCUBATOR ===

 * Each student has been asked to 'sponsor' at least one idea on the
   product idea list
   (http://jbs2010.wordpress.com/2010/05/20/sponsoring-incubator-product-ideas/)

 * We will split off into 3 or 4 product teams

==== REQUIREMENTS ====

 * Each product, when completed should meet at least 6 of these requirements: 
  * Uses GPS
  * Uses and or displays Maps
  * Touch screen's gestural interface
  * Uses a web server or service as the back end
  * Some kind of Database
  * Several public APIS
  * Could make money
  * Has social value
  * Impresses your Mom
  * Works with huge database
  * Uses the accelerometer
  * Uses Voice Recognition
  * other features that you are welcome to suggest ...

==== STAGES ====

The incubator projects will go through the full 8 weeks of the
summer. At the end of each week, you should be at a certain milestone
if you want to be able to complete the project.

 * Week 1: Groups chosen, high level features chosen, stories written
 * Week 2: Models designed and built. Default scaffolding for controllers 
      and views in place, project runs. Some initial features are implemented.
 * Week 3: Product is feature complete
 * Week 4: Product is stable enough, deployed to Heroku
 * Week 5: Mobile models designed, paper implementation
 * Week 6: Mobile models designed and built. Scaffolding for C&V in place
 * Week 7: Mobile Product is feature complete
 * Week 8: Mobile product is stable, and deployed to all students' Androids

The final project must have both web and mobile components, but it can be more
heavily weighted toward one or the other, at the groups discretion. 

==== PROCESS ====

 * You will create a github repository for your product. At the end of
   every day you should push the latest sources up to the repository

 * At any point, whatever code that is in the repository should run
   and do something (however little)

 * Many days there will be 1/2 hour for 'standup meetings' where each
   team will spend no more than 5 minutes summarizing: 'what was
   accomplished yesterday', 'what is planned for today', and 'what is
   blocking progress'

 * At the end of each week, each team will give a 1/2 hour status
   update, with a demo of the progress so far

 * At the end of week 4 and week 8, each team will hand in a 
   5-page paper covering the product market need, competiion and so on.
   And deliver a 1/2 hour presentation to the class. 
   Week 4 is an interim report, with final due on week 8.

 * Each team will maintain their Backlog and Stories in a
   PivotalTracker space
