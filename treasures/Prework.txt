We expect everyone to do some serious hacking with Ruby before the class starts. We expect you to have a good working knowledge of the Ruby language. Here are the specific assignments:


== Required Prework ==
 * Get your computer set up with Ruby and Git
 * Learn Git: http://progit.org/
 * Download the course notes repository: http://github.com/pitosalas/brandeis-cosci.git
 * Read chapters 1 through 10 of Programming Ruby
 * Play with this, you will find it useful: http://tryruby.org/ 
 * Write a program to do one of these problems:
  * SecretSanta
  * MadLibs
  * AnimalGame

You may work with one partner. Either one of you may be asked to explain the solution. 
In your code, follow the ProgrammingStyle

== Optional Prework ==

If you want to really hit the ground running, I also suggest the following:

 * Read as much of Part 1, 2 and 3 of Programming Ruby as you can
 * Read part 1 and 2 of Agile Development with Rails
