We expect everyone to do some serious hacking with Ruby before the class starts. We expect you to have a good working knowledge of the Ruby language. Here are the specific assignments. I encourage you to 'pair up' with one other of your course-mates so that you can learn from each other. Everyone though should write their own solutions to the 3 problems. 

During the first week we will have a show and tell of your work.

REQUIRED PREWORK

* Read part 1 and 2 of Programming Ruby
* Play with this, you will find it useful: http://tryruby.org/
* Implement one of the three programs. In your code, follow the source code guidelines
* Get your computer set up with Ruby and Git
* download the course notes repository: http://github.com/pitosalas/brandeis-cosci.git


OPTIONAL PREWORK

If you want to really hit the ground running, I also suggest the following:

* optional: Read as much of Part 1, 2 and 3 as you can
* optional: Read part 1 and 2 of Agile Development with Rails
