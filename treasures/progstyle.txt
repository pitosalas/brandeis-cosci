==== General Homework Guidelines ====

 * Always include your name and the Homework number in all paper or digital hand-ins to make sure it gets graded 
 
==== How to hand in so it gets graded ====

 1. Hand in on the morning that it is due
 1. Program source code should be on PAPER!
 1. Create a brief [:ScreenCasts: screencast] demonstrating running it and producing the right results.
 1. Check it in, by homework number, into your github repo

==== Style guide for Programming homework ====

All code handed in should follow these basic professional standards. Note that you will get three attempts to hand something in (before it gets graded)

 * All source files start with a comment block header explaining:
  * the name of the program, the homework assignment number
  * briefly its purpose
  * your name
  * specific preconditions to running it (e.g. install this gem)
  * command line(s) to run it and demonstrate that it works

  * You should demonstrate good programming habits:
   * All classes and many methods are preceded by something explaining it (can be as little as one sentence.)
   * Variable and other names should be well chosen. (Hint: if it's one letter, it may not be so well chosen.)

 * You should follow RUby Coding Conventions
  * Class names are capitalized CamelCase
  * Variables are lowercase, non-camel, underscore_separated
