SQL INJECTION

- what happens if a bad actor gets the ability to do sql commands directly to server
- how can sql injection work and what are the countermeasures

# WHAT NOT TO DO - an example
Project.find(:all, :conditions => "name = '#{params[:name]}'")

# Then user enters this in the box:
; DELETE FROM PROJECTS; SELECT * from projects where '1'='1

# Resultant command is:
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE name = ''; DELETE FROM PROJECTS; SELECT * from projects where '1'='1'

# Deleting all the projects

- as a general rule, never execute user input directly
- but this can be pretty subtle

SESSION HIJACKING
ref: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#_sql_injection
- sessions are the way to make http (stateless) act statefull
- sessions are tied to each other via a magic code (sessionID)
- if you can learn that you can pretend to be me (kind of like a temporary password)
- session guideline: don't store large objects in session (store them in db)
- session guideline: don't store critical data in a session
- How can session info be stolen? Network sniffer; examination of user's computer
- More tricky: session fixation attack where attacker tricks real user into using a known session
- Session expiration is also a good general countermeasure

FILE UPLOADS
- When an application allows a file upload, the user specifies the path
- Make sure the path is properly filtered so it can't clobber important files

PASSWORDS
- Use rational rules for preventing dictionary attacks
- Rules like: length of pw, mix of character types, lookup in dictionary of common passwords, force user to change pw periodically
- Make rules appropriate to the user and the application
- Check them

WHITELISTS vs. BLACKLISTS
- When protecting something, you can either compare the value to a list of permitted values (white list) or a list of prohibited values (black list)
- What are pros and cons of each one?
- Compare: false negative to false positive. Discuss.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING
- Describe the process by which I was granted a staff account
