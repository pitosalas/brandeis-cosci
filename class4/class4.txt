REVIEW

- ip addresses, packet switching, routers
- we can get a bunch of bits from one computer to another

TCP

- transport control protocol
- handles delivery of those bits to and from a particular "application" to another "application"
- adds a 'port' number
- the 'application' aka the 'server' and the other application aka the 'client'

DEMO

- we will build an example of a client and a server.
- there are two separate applications: myclient and myserver
- my client asks for a fortune and myserver gives you a random fortune
