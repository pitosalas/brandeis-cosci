* write two applications. One called tcpclient and one called tcpserver

myclient.rb

* displays a prompt: >>
* when user types in, a connection is made to server, over port 8888, and text is sent
* whatever comes back is displayed on the console

myserver.rb

* awaits a connection over port 8888
* if text that is sent is "t", then, the server responds with time of day
* if text that is sent is "f", then the server responds with a fortune

Hints:
- Use the GServer class
- This does not require Rails
- You can test the server (to some extent) with a web browser
- You can run the whole thing on your own computer

* Modify myserver.rb as follows:
  * if the text that is sent is d followed by a filename (e.g. dtest.txt) then respond with that file
