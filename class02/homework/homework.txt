==== RUBY CLIENT AND SERVER ASSIGNMENT ==== 

* Here are two applications (see homework directory)

myclient.rb

* displays a prompt: >>
* when user types in, a connection is made to server, over port 8888, and text is sent
* whatever comes back is displayed on the console

myserver.rb

* awaits a connection over port 8888
* if text that is sent is "t", then, the server responds with time of day
* if text that is sent is "f", then the server responds with a fortune

* DELIVERABLE: Update the comments for both programs to follow progstyle.txt
* DELIVERABLE: What does line 12 and line 26 in myserver.rb do?

* DELIVERABLE: Modify myserver.rb as follows:
  * if the text that is sent is d followed by a filename (e.g. dtest.txt) then respond with that file
  * what if the text file contains html? What would it take to get it to display in a browser?

ROUTING ASSIGNMENT

 * DELIVERABLE: Add logic to your server so it accepts commands that look like these. Do as many as you can

date
time
message/joke
message/fortune
message/joke?lang=en
message/joke?lang=someotherlanguage

 * Make sure you have a good installation of Ruby, Rails, and Gem on your computer
