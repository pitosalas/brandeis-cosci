==== URLS ====

 * Take a look at a url
 * Let's take it apart
 * What does it stand for?
 * What are the parts of a URL
 * http:// -> protocol
 * brandeis.edu -> where's the server
 * So the client -- your computer needs to be able to 'talk to' the server
 * Hm. So is http a protocol?
 * What about tcp/ip. What does that stand for?
 * So we have 3 protocols already: http, tcp and ip.

==== DEMO ====

{{{$ curl http://brandeis.edu
$ curl http://www.brandeis.edu
$ curl -v http://www.brandeis.edu}}}

 * What does curl do?
 * Why do brandeis.edu and www.brandeis.edu act differently?
 * Why does it act differently from in the browser?
 * Who handles HTTP result-codes?

==== PROTOCOLS ====

 * A protocol is a set of rules
 * Protocols determine the way information is interpreted 'on the wire'
 * You can think of them as 'envelopes'
 * Imagine I mail a big box of books to 'brandeis unversity, South Street, Waltham MA'
 * Inside the box there are smaller boxes: 'computer science dept', 'math dept', etc.
 * Each book is in an envelope: J. Smith, F. Johnson, etc.
 * So with protocols are the first set of bits the 'higher' or 'lower' level protocol?

==== TCP ====

 * transport control protocol, on TOP of IP
 * handles delivery of those bits to and from a particular "application" to another "application"
 * adds a 'port' number to IP
 * the 'application' aka the 'server' and the other application aka the 'client'
 * Sockets

==== HTTP ====
 * One of the foundational protocols of the web (other ones are?)
 * Request -> Response. Stateless.
 * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol, HTTP Protocol]
 * At the heart: a way to deliver 'URL' in to a 'Web Server' and tell it what to do with it and then process the result (TCP/IP not required!)
 * URL -- URI?
 * HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE... and others
 * HTTP Request: Do <method> to this <url> resource.
 * HTTP Response: <status> happened. Here's the result: <result>

Example Request:
{{{GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
}}}
Example Response:
{{{HTTP/1.1 200 OK
