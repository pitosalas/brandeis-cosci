REVIEW

* protocols are always layered, one on top of the other
* lower level protocols are 'closer to the hardware'
* higher level protocols are 'closer to the user'
* question: could you call .mp3 or .jpg a protocol?

STARTING AT THE LOWEST LEVEL: IP

* it's not really the lowest level
* IP: "internetwork" protocol
* it's job is to get data between one 'host' (=computer or server) and another
* Like the boxes, we need an address from and to
* "IP address!" 123.22.112.1  IPv6 ...

CONCEPTS WE LEARN FROM IP addresses

* Decentralized 'distribution' of a key
* Problem: I want to have a unique key that is guaranteed to be unique
* But, I don't want to have to go to a central authority to get the key
* Discussion: By the way, why not?
* Other examples of this principle?

SECOND CONCEPT

* We don't want 'people' to remember 12.31.2.123
* Why not? What problems would arise?
* Instead what do people remember easier?
* Any regular life examples of this?
* Solution: Indirection. But now we need a directory. Why?
* DNS: distributed name service

IP

* So the IP address = 1 specific 'host' or server
* (as usual there are exceptions :)
* IP is the way servers talk 'to each other' to get a packet of bits between them
* Conceptually, 'send these bits to this ip address'
* Problems: your client isn't attached to my server by a wire
* So who is that message sent to?

ENTER PACKET SWITCHING

* Big deal when it was invented
* Contrast with POTS
* There was a 'connection' literally between my phone and yours
* Packet switching breaks message into pieces and sends them all on their way
* Each one finds its own way to the target
* Other components of the network? Routers


Firewalls and NAT
* architecture of firewall between open internet and local internet
* NAT, DMZ, ....
* HTTP tunneling, AJAX ...
