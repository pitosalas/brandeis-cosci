	<h1>
		New Stuff in CSSEdit <span>2.5</span>
	</h1>
	
	<p>
		CSSEdit 2.5 comes with a ton of improvements, and several great new features for everyone.
	</p>
	
	<h3>
		Tabs and Revamped Preview
	</h3>
	<p>
		Yes! CSSEdit has tabs now &mdash; arguably the hottest and most flexible tabs you have ever encountered. Both style sheets and previews are equipped with tabs, allowing you to split them off into separate windows, drag them around, combine them, etc.
	</p>
	<h3>
		X-ray Inspector
	</h3>
	<p>
		X-ray has received a major overhaul in 2.5, and is now completely integrated with your style sheets. The new Inspector shows you what styles apply to the selected element, even for online web pages! Ideal for instantly understanding complex style sheets.
	</p>
	
	<h3>
		Selector Builder
	</h3>
	<p>
		Ever wondered how "body &gt; div:hover + #id:focus ~ .class::after" styles something on a page? So did we! With the Selector Builder, you can create (and understand) more complex style selectors using an innovative visual interface.
	</p>
	
	<h3>
		Better CodeSense
	</h3>
	<p>
		CSSEdit's source editor is now even more powerful. The intelligent CodeSense scans your style sheets for existing classes and identifiers, offering you to complete them at the touch of a button. Achieve unseen source productivity!
	</p>
	
	<h3>
		It's Just Better&trade;
	</h3>
	<p>
		As always, just about everything has been enhanced: there is now a font picker, the Preview has a navigation bar, the interface has been streamlined, bugs have been squashed&hellip;
	</p>
