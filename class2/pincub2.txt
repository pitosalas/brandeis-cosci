PROJECT MANAGEMENT

* purpose
* different from leadership

SCHEDULES

* The triad: time - features - quality
* Project management is a way to get a handle on this triad

PROJECTS

* there are different kinds of projects and they call for different techniques
* some of the tradeoffs:
** How well understood is the 'problem'? Brainstorm some examples
** Is there (can there be) a spec?
** How much time (order of magnitude) is there?
** What is the experience level of the team members?
