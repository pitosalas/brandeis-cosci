MVC + RAILS INTRO

RAILS

- What is it? 
- "Convention over Configuration"
- The Rails 'stack'

DEMO (Page 35 ADR book)
- demo a hello world rails app
- how to launch server
- how to look at result
- tour of the code

ROUTING

* Take a look at Routes.rb
* Make a change to it to show the result
* This can get fairly complicated by the way
* Try accessing a url that doesn't route yet. What happens?

MVC

- Model: purely data representation. No UI. Connects to database
- View: purely UI, no data. How information is displayed to the screen
- Controller: Implement actions by calling code and then displaying new Views

MORE DEMO (Rest of Chapter 4)

- Show where M, V and C are in the code
- Make a change to see the result
