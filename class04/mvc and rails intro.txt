ROUTING

Look at these URLS:
	http://www.facebook.com/pitosalas?ref=profile
	http://www.jewishboston.com/events/67-glbt-and-and-friends-shabbat-potluck
	
* Let's deconstruct:
	What does http:// tell us?
	What does www.facebook.com tell us
	What does /pitosalas tell us?
	What does ?ref=profile tell us?
	
* Routing runs the specific code 'inside the server'

* Take a look at Routes.rb
* Make a change to it to show the result
* This can get fairly complicated by the way
* Try accessing a url that doesn't route yet. What happens?

MVC

- Model: purely data representation. No UI. Connects to database
- View: purely UI, no data. How information is displayed to the screen
- Controller: Implement actions by calling code and then displaying new Views

MORE DEMO (Rest of Chapter 4)

- Show where M, V and C are in the code
- Make a change to see the result
