REVIEW

* We now understand how URLs are used to refer to 'resources'

ROUTING

Look at these URLS:
	http://www.facebook.com/pitosalas?ref=profile
	http://www.jewishboston.com/events/67-glbt-and-and-friends-shabbat-potluck
	
* Let's deconstruct:
	What does http:// tell us?
	What does www.facebook.com tell us
	What does /pitosalas tell us?
	What does ?ref=profile tell us?
	
* Routing runs the specific code 'inside the server'
