 * Standard Use of CSS in HTML
  * links to css files in head element
  * tags in body have id or class attributes specifying css in head
 * Contextual CSS selectors
  * can specify contexts in which CSS is applied, e.g. the following CSS
    would put a border around any form which appears in an HTML element
    with the id "forgotpw"

        #forgotpw form {border:thick solid blue}

   likewise we can attach style to all td elements in a table of class "month"
   using

       table.month td {padding:5px; margin:2px; border:2px solid black}

   See the specification for more details on this useful functionality:
      http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#pattern-matching

 * Priority
  CSS can be specified in many different ways, e.g. 
  * in line via the style attribute
     <td style="color:red">....</td>
  * in the head using the style element
    <style type="text/css">
       td.holiday {color:red}
    </style>
    where the corresponding td would have a class selector
    <td class="red">July 4</td>
  * in an external style sheet, for example the file calendar.css might contain
       td.holday {color:red}
    where the head of the HTML would contain a link to that file:
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="calendar.css" />
  * or in a CSS file imported from a CSS file that is included!
    you can import a CSS file into another one by including the line
      import "base.css";
    at the top of the CSS file (don't forget the semicolon!)
  CSS has a rigid set of rules that explains how to specify style on a tag
  that comes under the influence of several different bits of CSS (e.g. 
  inline CSS, CSS in the head, CSS linked from a file, CSS on a tag, 
  CSS on a tag with a class specifier, CSS with only a class specifier, etc.
  The main idea is that the most specific selector wins, and if two are equal
  then the one processed last wins.
