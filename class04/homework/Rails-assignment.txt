RAILS Assigment

- Make sure you have a good installation of Ruby, Rails, and Gem on your computer
- I recommend Ruby 1.8.x and Rails 2.3.x but you are welcome to try Ruby 1.9
- Create a Rails application, for example: "music" (any other trivial list manager is ok)
- For music, have the application contain "Title", "Genre", "Artist", "Date Added"
- Provide CRUD functionality

HINTS

- Read the tutorials because you can do a quick and easy version of this assignment a few shell commands
- But it's ok if you want to be fancier
- Review and understand the folder structure created. We will discuss this in class
