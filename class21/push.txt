PUSH

* What is 'Push'?
* When my desktop email dings, was there 'Push'?
* Remember Request/Response model of HTTP
* Remember Socket that is waiting for a request in TCP/IP
* Is there really a difference between polling and push?

PUSH IN MOBILE

* When my cell phone rings, is that push?
* Discussion: How does that work?
* Push in mobile means: "an application can alert the user of some event even when the app is not running"
* Considerations
  - multi tasking
  - battery life
  - connectivity

HOW DOES PUSH IN IPHONE WORK?

* @TODO: study it in the manual and write it up
