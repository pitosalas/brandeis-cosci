==== WELCOME ====

 * Some stories: Starting of eRoom; Open Source software for elections; my first patent; how to get into wikipedia
 * About complexity: wheels within wheels. layers. amazing that it all works. Abstractions and Leaky abstractions
 * About programming languages: most don't know ruby yet. modern. you will learn many languages and platforms. don't get too attached. the principles cary over. some ideas are re-invented over and over again
 * Difference between a school assignment/academic project and a product that you can build a career around. patents. 10% 'interesting', 90% blocking and tackling. 'remember your helmet.'
 * Review of underlying principles. Modern platforms give a false sense of security. Write a blogging service in 10 minutes. But it's not real. Real systems are complex. Abstractions Leak. All is not what it seems.
