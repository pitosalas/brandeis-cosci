WELCOME

* Some stories: Starting of eRoom; Open Source software for elections; my first patent; how to get into wikipedia
* About programming languages and platforms. assume you will learn many. don't get too attached to any. they are not precious
* About complexity: wheels within wheels. layers. amazing that it all works
* About programming languages: most dont know ruby yet. modern. you will learn many languages and platforms. dont get too attached. the principles cary over. some ideas are re-invented over and over again
* Difference between a school assignment/academic project and a product that you can build a carreer around. patents. 10% 'interesting', 90% blocking and tackling. 'remember your helmet.'

	- immerse yourself into the concepts and practices that go into building web applications
	- develop an understanding of the architectures and the tradeoffs
	- develop an real-world skill in using the tools
	- there aren't pat answers. there are no textbooks.
	-  Learn to think analytically to solve problems whe
