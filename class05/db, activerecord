DATABASES

* A way to manage large amounts of data
* Stored on disk (or in memory, or elsewhere)
* Tables containing records (or objects, or other things)
* Examples: SQL Databases, DNS database, Hierarchical file system, etc. etc.

CRUD

* Simplistic way to look at operations: Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete
* Data Types
* Access Control
* Administration

SQL Databases

* Most common still
* SQL is a simple programming/command language
* Oddly you don't actually use it that much
* All SQL databases are table-oriented

INTERACTIVE DEMO

* Use SQL command line
* Use GUI

JOIN

* Family of operations to allow tables to be combined
* 3d Normal form
* Avoiding duplication

OR MAPPING

* How does a relational table get accessed in an OO language?
* Pros and Cons
* Introducing: Object / Relational Mapping
* Goal: to be able to access relational tables *as if* they are classes and objects
* It's an abstraction
* Below the surface, they are still actual relational tables
* Above the surface they function much like standard classes
