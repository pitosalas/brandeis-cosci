==== DATABASES ==== 

  * A way to manage large amounts of data
  * Stored on disk (or in memory, or elsewhere)
  * Tables containing records (or objects, or other things)
  * Examples: SQL Databases, DNS database, Hierarchical file system, etc. etc.

==== CRUD ====

  * Simplistic way to look at operations: Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete
  * Data Types
  * Access Control
  * Administration

==== SQL Databases ==== 

  * Most common still. "Relational" database
  * SQL is a simple programming/command language. Let's look at some examples.
  * Oddly you don't actually use it that much. Too many dialects.
  * All SQL databases are table-oriented. What makes a SQL database a SQL database?

==== INTERACTIVE DEMO ==== 

  * Use SQL command line
  * Use GUI

==== JOIN ==== 

  * Family of operations to allow tables to be combined
  * 3d Normal form
  * Avoiding duplication
  
==== EXAMPLE ====

 * Something from one of the projects
 * How would that be mapped into a relational table?

==== OR MAPPING ==== 

  * How does a relational table get accessed in an OO language?
  * Pros and Cons
  * Introducing: Object / Relational Mapping
  * Goal: to be able to access relational tables *as if* they are classes and objects
  * It's an abstraction
  * Below the surface, they are still actual relational tables
  * Above the surface they function much like standard classes
